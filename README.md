# Changeo-O Automatization
Change-O consists in a software package for B/T cell receptor V(D)J gene assignment, clonality inference and germline reconstruction.
Change-O makes part of [immcantation framework](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and I highly encourage the reading of Change-O github page [here](https://changeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

# Pre-requirements 
In order to run Change-O's automatization scripts, some pieces of software are required or encourage to be used:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an package and enviroment manager that exists to facilitates our lifes. You can find basic instruction to install and create anaconda's enviroment [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-anaconda-python-distribution-on-ubuntu-20-04).
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the programming language required to run the scripts.
- [awk](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) programming language is also required to run Change-O's automation scripts. A ```pip install awk ``` inside an anaconda enviroment should be enough to make the magic happens.
