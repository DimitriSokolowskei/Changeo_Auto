# Changeo-O Automatization
Change-O consists in a software package for B/T cell receptor V(D)J gene assignment, clonality inference and germline reconstruction.
Change-O makes part of [immcantation framework](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and I highly encourage the reading of Change-O github page [here](https://changeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
